I built a bespoke market analysis dashboard which contains candlestick charts, Bollinger bands, market cap tree maps and growth plots of 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Index. In addition, I have applied various techniques to carry out this project such as table calculations for moving averages and rolling maximums, promotion of dimensional filters to context filters, creation of collapsible containers, data blending, parameter actions for next-level dashboard interactivity and much more.
